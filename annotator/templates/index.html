      <p>
        Annotator is a Javascript shim that you can insert into any page, allowing
        you to select and annotate text, images, or (almost) anything else.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How do I use it?</strong> We think you'll get the hang of it
        pretty quickly. It's running right now on this page &mdash; try it out
        by selecting some text and clicking on the note icon. Enter a note and
        press <tt>&ldquo;Enter &#x21A9;&rdquo;</tt>: you should see your annotation
        as a highlighted piece of text. Hover over the highlight with your mouse
        to view, edit and delete the annotation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What happens to my annotations?</strong> The ones you create on
        this page will get lost in the ether, but Annotator comes with the ability
        to save your annotations to a remote server. Preliminary support for
        saving to an entirely different website is available using
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/" title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">
        CORS</a>. A reference backend is available at
        <a href="https://github.com/okfn/annotator-store-flask">okfn/annotator-store-flask</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Give me the code!</strong> Right, go get a tagged release from
        <a href="https://github.com/okfn/annotator/downloads">this page</a>,
        load <tt>annotator.min.js</tt> and <tt>annotator.min.css</tt> into your page,
        and add the following Javascript<sup><a href="#jquery">1</a></sup>:
      </p>

      <blockquote><p><code>$('body').annotator()</code></p></blockquote>

      <p>
        When we get a moment we're also going to knock together a bookmarklet to
        load Annotator into any page, saving annotations to a server of your choice.
      </p>

      <p class="footnote">
        <a name="jquery">1:</a> I'm assuming you're already using <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, right?
        If not you'll need to load that too. Best use Google's CDN with a URL like <tt>http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js</tt>.
